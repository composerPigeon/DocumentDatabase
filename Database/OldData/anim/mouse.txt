Mice, often underestimated due to their diminutive size, are integral components of ecosystems worldwide. Found in a variety of habitats, from urban landscapes to remote wilderness areas, these small rodents play vital roles as both consumers and prey. Despite their reputation as pests in human environments, mice contribute to ecosystem health by dispersing seeds, regulating insect populations, and serving as a food source for numerous predators. Their rapid reproduction and adaptable nature enable them to thrive in diverse environments, making them ubiquitous and resilient creatures in the natural world.
