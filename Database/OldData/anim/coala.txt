The koala, a marsupial native to Australia, is instantly recognizable by its fluffy ears and distinctive nose. These arboreal creatures are primarily herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. Koalas spend most of their time sleeping in trees, conserving energy due to their low-calorie diet. Despite their cute appearance, koalas face threats such as habitat loss and disease, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect these unique animals.
