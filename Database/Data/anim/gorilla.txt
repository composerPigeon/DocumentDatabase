Gorillas, the largest living primates, inhabit the dense forests of central Africa. These magnificent animals are known for their immense strength and gentle demeanor. Gorillas live in close-knit family groups led by a dominant silverback male, who ensures the safety and well-being of the troop. Despite facing threats such as habitat loss and poaching, conservation efforts have helped stabilize gorilla populations in some areas, underscoring the importance of protecting their natural habitats.
