The giant panda, native to China, is renowned for its distinctive black and white fur and peaceful demeanor. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas primarily consume bamboo, consuming large quantities daily to meet their energy needs. Conservation efforts have been crucial in saving this iconic species from the brink of extinction, with populations slowly recovering both in the wild and in captivity.
